Overrides standard touch interactions and allows for proper multitouch interaction within websites. 0 dependencies (other than a decent browser)

## Demo

## To-do
* Add containers to prevent elements being dragged and scaled beyond bounds
* Add a way to differentiate between scale and resize
* Make handling of events optional so developers can override if they wish
* Add gesture events similar to hammerjs but for multiple touchpoints at once
* Refactoring, lots and lots of refactoring
